# DCBasic

A terminal wrapper implementation of the Dreamcacher Logging System. Operates by wrapping around terminal commands and logging the following:
 - Stdout
 - Stderror
 - Exit code
 - Environment variables
 - Directory location
 - Current date/time 
 
This version of the Dreamcacher Logging System is intended to be used on a per-command basis. It allows the user to individually choose the commands they wish to log at the tradeoff of logging efficiency and overhead computing power. 

The Dreamcacher Kernel-Terminal Middleman Daemon will soon be in development for use in enterprise and mass/passive logging scenarios.
