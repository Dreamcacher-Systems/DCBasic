# DCBasic

A terminal wrapper implementation of the Dreamcacher Logging System. Operates by wrapping around terminal commands and logging the following:
 - Stdout
 - Stderror
 - Exit code
 - Environment variables
 - Directory location
 
This version of the Dreamcacher Logging System is intended to be used on a per-command basis. It allows the user to individually choose the commands they wish to log at the tradeoff of logging efficiency and overhead computing power. 

The Dreamcacher Kernel-Terminal Middleman Daemon is currently in development for use in enterprises and mass-logging.
